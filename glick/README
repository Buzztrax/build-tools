Glick is an application that lets developers easily create application bundles
of their applications. An application bundle is a single file that contains all
the data and files needed to run an application, so all the user has to do is
start it. There is no need to install it, and if you don't like it you can just
remove that file and the whole program will be gone.

1.) install glick from:
http://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick/

2.) mkdir install

3.) glick-shell ./install/ ./run.sh
